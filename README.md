# coronary-artery-stenosis-detection
Using Faster RCNN with 'inception resNetv2' as backbone architecture to detect stenosis regions within coronary artery from coronary CT angiography.

We utilized the object-detection-API by tensorflow to train our model and detect stenosis region of coronary artery.
